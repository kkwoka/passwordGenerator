1. When user clicks on generate password, my password generator program begins.


2. Prompt user of how many characters?
    validate that use tuped in a number that is 8-128

        if number user typed in is less than 8 OR more than 128 OR not a number,
            ask user to try again

        else
            proceed to next steps!


3. character types (booleans), user must select at least 1
    Special characters
    numerical characters
    lowercase characters
    uppercase characters

    If user selects yes for any of these variables, add that selected array to a separate variable.
    This separate variable will include all TRUE (user seleted) variables.

    If user does NOT select any of the variables, nothing will happen, no password will be generated. The user will need to start over.

4. Generate password
    Given: 
        the size of the password the user wants (the length they have chosen between 8-128 characters) 
        the chosen variables the user wants
    Result:
        password will be generated (RETURNED) based on user selected criteria

5. Clear existing password so the user could start over.

Bonus - Copy To Clipboard
    Should the user want to copy their newly generated password, without doing it manually themselves, click the "copy to Clipboard" button which will do the work for them.
