# Password Generator
This project will allow a user to create a randomly generated password using 4 suggested variables. The user can select any or all of the variables to use in their password. If they do not select any variables to use, it will not create a password. If they would like to start over with a new password, they can "reset" the generator by pressing the Reset button. If they would like to "copy" their password, they may press the Copy To Clipboard button.
